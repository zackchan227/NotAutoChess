The diamond floating in the moonlit night
So beautiful
Look up, it’s twinkling in the sky
Where you can never reach it
So far away, ah…

Is it shining all around me?
Fate’s weighing on me?
Go against the flow and live my life

It has begun in the deep darkness
The shadow of the moon
I hope the end is in the brightness

Pray only for you under the shining stars
A girl is into you
Yes, I am your étoile

Water lilies sleep in the gentle air
The crack of dawn
Listen, the sound of lovely leaves
in the woods slowly awaken
So let ‘em sway, ah…

Don’t you worry, you’re still learning
Don’t take it all on
It cannot be like this forever

For hundreds of years, she never would wake up
Like Sleeping Beauty, she
was waiting for her Prince Charming, and

It’s crazy to me, ‘cause I need you right now
My feelings for you grow
And they just overflow

Thousands of stars, but I won’t give up
I’ll give it all I’ve got
To make my dream come true

I will light up only for you,
and wish that you’ll be mine
A girl is into you
Yes, I am your étoile
