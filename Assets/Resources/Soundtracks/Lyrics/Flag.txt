As the moon is swaying by the trees
On the water, silver and blue
My reflection gives me misery
As I stop to think of you

You believed in me
The dream we see
And our wish to someday come true
I will fight for you and I
Yes, I will come through

Through our skies filled with memories
Of days bright and anew
All my life, all my might
I will fight for the glory of God
And the vow made to you

As I hold you in my arms
I’ll shut tight, won’t let go
On this journey, we’re together forever, and so

Forgive me for betraying the promise I keep
I am stronger now I have you
The dark in my mind has vanished and gone
This curse no longer be

You have saved me once
And I have learned to return the favor and deed
Of the miracle you gave to me
All the love and trust you keep 

Until we meet once again one day
Keep the light shinning through
I will be no fool
I will follow through for you

Through our skies filled with memories
Of days bright and anew
All my life, all my might
I will fight for the glory of God
And the vow made to you

As I hold you in my arms
I’ll shut tight, won’t let go
On this journey, we’re together forever, and so

Forgive me for betraying the promise I keep
I am stronger now I have you
The dark in my mind has vanished and gone
This curse no longer be

No more weaknesses
All my promises
Black and white memories circling my head

Color's coming back
Now they can't beat us forevermore
Never ever again

So forgive me for betraying the promise I keep
I am stronger when I have you
I'll take a leap
We will fight against the evil that curses this land

We will bring back what was once sacred to man

When I hold you in my arms
I'll shut tight, won't let go
On this journey, we're together forever, and so 

Forgive me for betraying the promise I keep
I am stronger now I have you
The dark in my mind has vanished and gone
This curse no longer be
