11:I'm walking in the early morning 
13:Carrying emptiness, alone
16:The hazy fuzzy shadow is following
19:No one comforts me
22:My overflowing hope has already withered away
27:Only an empty heart remained here
30:It's so quiet here
32:I wish I could erase my memories 
37:Just keep it all from my mind
42:Sometimes I can't remember, how do I breathe?
48:But it's okay, I'll find a way to smile 
75:Whenever you were nice to me
77:Whenever you made me smile
81:I was so afraid of losing those precious moments 
86:You always gave me unconditional love, 
88:but I denied 
92:I was running blind in darkness,
94:and trying to forget 
96:I wish I could erase my memories 
101:Of all the people I have met
106:Am I wrong to think
109:that your love isn't worth believin'?
112:Can anyone fix my broken feelings?
117:I've lost the will to live, but I'm afraid of dying
123:I'm on my own in this cold, empty night
126:And still here breathing 
129:Even the brightest light feels like a trap offered by
134:A day shadow, and I cannot believe it 
137:Cannot take it
150:I was sure I could do anything 
153:Never thought there were things to fear
155:Wherever I am, wherever you are
157:I was sure I would have a bright n' shiny cheerful life 
161:Now it's too late to know what your words mean to me
163:I knew that my heart was a lonely, withered, wilted flower 
167:Ah, I feel a warm wind tonight 
170:I've lost the will to live, but I'm afraid of dying
175:I'm on my own in this cold, empty night
179:And still here breathing
181:And I'm okay with that, even you're not here
187:A gleam of light is coming from the sky
194:No matter how I spend my days
196:I've still got room left to grow
200:I won't deny myself anymore
203:Make me feel like me
205:Even the brightest light feels like a trap offered by
211:A dark shadow, but now I can believe 
215:I'm reaching for the sky 
220:I'm reaching for the sky 
225:I'm reaching for the sky 
230:I'm reaching for my dreams
