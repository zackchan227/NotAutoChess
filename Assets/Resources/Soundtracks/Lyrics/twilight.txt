I'm walking in the early morning 
Carrying emptiness, alone
The hazy fuzzy shadow is following
No one comforts me
My overflowing hope has already withered away
Only an empty heart remained here
It's so quiet here
I wish I could erase my memories 
Just keep it all from my mind
Sometimes I can't remember, how do I breathe?
But it's okay, I'll find a way to smile 
Whenever you were nice to me
Whenever you made me smile
I was so afraid of losing those precious moments 
You always gave me unconditional love, 
but I denied 
I was running blind in darkness,
and trying to forget 
I wish I could erase my memories 
Of all the people I have met
Am I wrong to think
that your love isn't worth believin'?
Can anyone fix my broken feelings?
I've lost the will to live, but I'm afraid of dying
I'm on my own in this cold, empty night
And still here breathing 
Even the brightest light feels like a trap offered by
A day shadow, and I cannot believe it 
Cannot take it
I was sure I could do anything 
Never thought there were things to fear
Wherever I am, wherever you are
I was sure I would have a bright n' shiny cheerful life 
Now it's too late to know what your words mean to me
I knew that my heart was a lonely, withered, wilted flower 
Ah, I feel a warm wind tonight 
I've lost the will to live, but I'm afraid of dying
I'm on my own in this cold, empty night
And still here breathing
And I'm okay with that, even you're not here
A gleam of light is coming from the sky
No matter how I spend my days
I've still got room left to grow
I won't deny myself anymore
Make me feel like me
Even the brightest light feels like a trap offered by
A dark shadow, but now I can believe 
I'm reaching for the sky 
I'm reaching for the sky 
I'm reaching for the sky 
I'm reaching for my dreams
